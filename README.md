# chess-algo-experiments

This is just a short experiment to better understand the minimax algorithm. Hence, this is no attempt to build a chess engine, or put more than minimal effort into the board evaluation.

If I were to spend more time on it, I would likely investigate
* alpha-beta pruning
* implementation with WebAssembly/C++
* generalize the implementation to abstract from the game of chess
